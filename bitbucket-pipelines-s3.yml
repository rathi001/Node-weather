#  Template React Deploy

#  This template allows you to deploy your React app to an AWS S3 bucket and invalidate the old AWS Cloudfront distribution.
#  The workflow allows running tests, code linting and security scans on feature branches (as well as master).
#  The react app will be validated, deployed to S3 and trigger an AWS Cloudfront distribution invalidation to refresh the CDN caches after the code is merged to master.

# Prerequisites: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY setup in the Deployment variables.
# For advanced cases, please, follow examples from the pipe's:
# README https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/aws-s3-deploy/src/master/README.md
